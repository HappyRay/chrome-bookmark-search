<span id="msg" style="color:red"></span>
I am sorry if this disturbs you, but I have to inform you about the changes.
<h2>Version 1.3</h2>
<ul id="v1.3">
<li>(internal) Switched to manifest version 2.</li>
<li>The persist permission to "your data on all websites" and "your tabs and browsing activity" is removed.<br />
Instead an option is added for enabling support for JavaScript bookmarklet.<br />
The related permissions will be requested only when the option is enabled.</li>
<li>A bug that prevents automatically navigating to the only match when the option "Automatically selects full match on name" is disabled is fixed.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2>Version 1.2.1</h2>
<ul id="v1.2.1">
